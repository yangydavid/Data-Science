    "> In this lecture, we will first look at how degree of linear regression and sample dataset size will cause *overfitting* in linear regression. To deal with overfitting, *regularized least squares* will be introduced. When predicting the label of a new observation in linear regression, if we want to rely more on nearby traing data than distant training data, we will resort to *locally-weighted linear regression*. Finally, we will show regular linear regression and regularized linear regression can be interpreted from probablistic perspective each using *maximum likelihood estimation* and *maximum a posteriori estimation*."

    ">   - **Degree**\n",
    ">       - When degree is really small, the regressor is not powerful enough (i.e. degree is small) to learn the underlying true model. At this time, underfitting occurs. Both training error and test error are high.\n",
    ">       - As degree increases, regressor become more powerful enough to roughly learn the true model but not that powerful to also take the noise into considerations. At this time, underfitting reduces. Both training error and test error will be smaller. \n",
    ">       - As degree further increases, regressor become so powerful that it could fit most of the data in training dataset perfectly. And since the data are noisy, the learned model actually deviates from the true model. At this time, overfitting occurs. Training error could becomes very small (even 0 sometimes), while test error increases. \n",
    ">   - **Dataset Size**\n",
    ">       - When training dataset size is small, a powerful regressor (i.e. degree is high) can fit every single sample in training dataset. Therefore, noise is also considered. This is equivalent to the ending zone of the plot (left) with respect degree.\n",
    ">       - As training dataset size increases, since the power of regressor is finite (degree is fixed), regressor starts to fail to fit every single sample. Instead it seeks to learn a curve such that samples will fall on both sides equally. Since the noise are assumed to 0 mean Gaussian noise which is symmetric with respect to 0, this is actually close to the underlying true curve.\n",
    ">       - The training error and test error will converge to 0.3 which is the variance of noise (you could check this by examining the Python code). This is not a coincidence and can be derived. We will cover this later when we study **bias-variance tradeoff**\n",

    ">    - Of the above expression, $\\frac{\\alpha}{\\beta}$ corresponds to the regularization coefficient $\\lambda$ we used in previous regulazied least squares.\n",
    ">    - **Priors**: Represent prior beliefs about acceptable values for model parameters.\n",
    ">    - Example: In linear regression, $\\ell^2$ regularization can be interpreted as placing a Gaussian Prior on the regression coefficients.\n",
    ">    - All statistical models and machine learning algorithms make assumptions.\n",
    ">        - All reasoning is based on implicit assumptions.\n",
    ">        - A Bayesian will tell you that his prior is a way of explicitly stating those assumptions.\n",
    ">    - This can all get very philosophical, but...\n",
    ">        - Bayesian reasoning is best seen as a useful tool.\n",
