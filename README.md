# Data-Science
The folder include some fundamental machine learing projects I did following the instructions from Dataquest.io The main puepose is to get familiar with the work flow of machine learning project in the Python enviroment. The learning algorithm includes both supervised learning and unsupervised learning listed as: 

1. Statistical machine learning
2. Unconstrained optimization
3. Bayes classifiers
4. Linear discriminant analysis
5. Naive Bayes
6. Logistic regression
7. Separating hyperplanes
8. Linear regression
9. Empirical risk minimization
10. Kernels
11. Kernel ridge regression
12. Constrained optimization
13. Support vector machines
14. Model selection
15. Principal component analysis
16. PCA, the SVD, and the generalized Rayleigh quotient
17. k-means
18. Expectation maximization and Gaussian mixture models
19. Kernel density estimation
20. Spectral clustering
21. Multidimensional scaling
22. Nonlinear dimensionality reduction
23. Feature selection
24. The alternating direction method of multipliers
25. Reinforcement learning
26. Markov decision processes
27. Optimal planning
28. Learning policies from experience
29. Decision trees
30. Ensemble methods
31. Boosting
32. Neural Networks
33. Reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces
34. Learning theory
35. Additional topics

I'd like to share this working folder with the Github community so that more collegues have access to ML/DS resources
