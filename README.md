# Data-Science
The folder include some fundamental machine learing projects I did. The main puepose is to get familiar with the work flow of machine learning project in the Python enviroment. The learning algorithm includes both supervised learning and unsupervised learning. I'd like to share this working folder with the Github community so that more collegues have access to ML/DS resources
